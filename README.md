## Brief: Kanban Board Bookings

At Hello, our operations team have to manage new bookings. We have a form to enter the member's details:

- Name
- Title
- Age
- Email
- Mobile Number

The board has 4 columns:

- **Unclaimed**: new cases
- **First Contact**: operations team contact member
- **Preparing Work Offer**: searching for Therapist
- **Send to Therapist**: matched with Therapist

This is what the board currently looks like:

## How to Start

This is a simple create-react-app application, the instructions on how to run can be found in [here](CONTRIBUTING.md).
We are using pure ReactJS with TypeScript here with styling done in pure CSS, but feel free to approach this however you want. If you want to use libraries, we encourage you to - there is no right or wrong answer here! We use tailwind and styled-components for styling internally, but we don't expect you to be familiar with these up front.

## Tasks

1. Please add validations to the member form, relevant error and helper messages.
2. Once 'Submit' is pressed, a card will be created on under _Unclaimed_ column.
3. The card will contain all the details entered into the form.
4. Please save new card data to _local storage_.
5. Previous entered cards will reload onto the board as saved in _local storage_.
6. Please add styling to the form and page.

## Review Interview

Once we have received your repository we will organise a follow-up interview to discuss your solution.

## Bonus: Tasks

If you have time and are feeling adventurous feel free to implement the bonus tasks listed below.

1. Implement the drag and drop of the cards to different columns.
2. Each column must indicate the number of cards.
3. Please add styling to the board and page.

If you don't have time, that's fine. During the interview, we will discuss strategies that you might have used to achieve these.

The final design of the board should look like this:
