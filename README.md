## Brief: Trello Board Bookings
At HelloSelf, our operations team have to manage new bookings. We have a form to enter the member's details:
- Name
- Title
- Age 
- Email
- Mobile Number

The board has 3 columns:
- **New**: pending new cases
- **Triage**: looking for corresponding Therapist
- **Matched**: matched with Therapist
A card cannot move from New -> Matched before going to Triage, same as Matched cannot move back to New. They can only move 1 column at a time.

Here is the design of the Trello Board:


## Task
1. Please add validations to the member form, and relevant error and helper messages
2. Once 'Submit' is pressed, a card will be created on under New column
3. Please save new card to *local storage* 
4. Previous entered cards will reload onto the board as saved in *local storage*
5. Please add styling to the form

## Bonus: Task
1. Implement the drag and drop ability of the cards, where it must follow the rules stated above
2. Card must indicate the current status/column they are in, feel free to use any kind of indicator
3. Please add styling to the board

## Review Interview
Once we have received your repository we will organise a follow-up interview to discuss your answers. =
