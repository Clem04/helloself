## Brief: Trello Board Bookings

At HelloSelf, our operations team have to manage new bookings. We have a form to enter the member's details:

- Name
- Title
- Age
- Email
- Mobile Number

The board has 4 columns:

- **Unclaimed**: new cases
- **First Contact**: operations team contact member
- **Preparing Work Offer**: searching for Therapist
- **Send to Therapist**: matched with Therapist

This is what the board currenlty looks like:

The final design of the board is:
